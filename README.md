# Tic-Tac-Toe
 A console based Tic-Tac-Toe that can be played with a friend or against one of three bots that perform moves slightly different from one another.
 The game starts by asking for a name of the "X" player and what type of player they are (Human or one of the bot modes), then it does the same for an "O" player.
 The game was made to learn object-oriented-programming and is not written as a full masterpeiece. There is no exception handling thus the game is very primitive.
 The four modes are Human player (you play), Random player(uses a random number generator to place mark on board), Blocking player( Performs random moves until it sees oppurtunity
 to block but will not try to win against you), and Smart player (which does all the other bot functions but also tries to win if it sees a winning move)
